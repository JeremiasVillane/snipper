## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Version 20.x.x or later.
- **npm/yarn/pnpm:** Package manager.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** A running PostgreSQL instance (e.g., local, Docker, Vercel Storage, Supabase, Railway).

### Setup .env file

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```dotenv
# === Required Variables ===

# Database URLs (ensure both point to your PostgreSQL instance)
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?schema=public"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database?schema=public"

# Application URL (replace with your deployment URL or http://localhost:3000 for dev)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# NextAuth configuration
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secure-random-secret" # Generate a strong secret key (e.g., using `openssl rand -base64 32`)

# === Optional: Authentication Providers ===

# Google OAuth Credentials (Required ONLY if you want Google login)
# Visit: [https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"

# === Optional: Monitoring, Analytics & Security Services ===
# These variables integrate with third-party services for enhanced monitoring, analytics,
# and security. They are NOT strictly required for the core functionality of Snipper
# if you are self-hosting, but are recommended for production environments.

# Arcjet (Bot Protection, Rate Limiting, etc.)
# Visit: [https://arcjet.com/](https://arcjet.com/)
ARCJET_KEY="your-arcjet-key"

# Sentry (Error Monitoring & Performance Tracking)
# Visit: [https://sentry.io/](https://sentry.io/)
SENTRY_ORG="your-sentry-org-name"
SENTRY_PROJECT="your-sentry-project-name"
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="your-sentry-auth-token"     # Required for build-time operations like source map uploads
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN="your-sentry-public-dsn" # Public DSN for client/server error reporting

# PostHog (Product Analytics)
# Visit: [https://posthog.com/](https://posthog.com/)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY="your-posthog-public-key"  # Public API Key for sending events
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST="[https://app.posthog.com](https://app.posthog.com)" # Your PostHog instance URL (Cloud default or self-hosted)

```

### Setup Prisma

Connect to your PostgreSQL database and set up the schema:

```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or yarn install / pnpm install

# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Push the schema to the database (creates tables)
npx prisma db push
```

### Start the Development Server

```shell
npm run dev
# or yarn dev / pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
